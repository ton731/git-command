### Fast Forward Merge
- When the master merge didn't commit since creating the new branch, and the new branch want to merge back into the master branch. The Fast-Forward-Merge just simply move the HEAD from master to the new branch.
- There are two steps, switch to the main branch and merge:
    1. git switch master
    2. git merge new-branch
